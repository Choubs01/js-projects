    <p>The game is similar to blackjack however a slight play on the rules. The dealer will keep hitting cards until
        their sum is at least 17, at which point they will hold. Here are the ways your money can change:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Overflow: </strong>If you overflow, your money halves. But if the dealer overflows, your money will
            double.</li>
        <li><strong>Blackjack: </strong>If you get a blackjack, your money doubles. Conversely, if the dealer gets a
            blackjack, your money will be cut in half. However, if you get a natural, your money will me multiplied by
            2.5.</li>
        <li><strong>New Game: </strong>If you start a new game and your card sum is greater than the dealers, your money
            is multiplied by 1.5. Conversely, if the dealers money exceeds yours, your money is divided by 1.75 i.e. it
            decreases by about 42%.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that these effects stack.</p>
